 * CS 2110 Fall 2021 HW1
 * Part 3 - Coding with bitwise operators
 *
 * @author Anthony Wong
 *
 * Global rules for this file:
 * - All of these functions must be completed in ONE line. That means they
 *   should be of the form "return [...];". No partial credit will be awarded
 *   for any method that isn't completed in one line.
 *
 * - You may not use conditionals.
 * - You may not declare any variables.
 * - You may not use casting.
 * - You may not use the unsigned right shift operator (>>>)
 * - You may not write any helper methods, or call any method from this or
 *   another file to implement any method. Recursive solutions are not
 *   permitted.
 * - You may not use addition or subtraction. However, you may use the
 *   unary negation operator (-) to negate a number.
 * - You may not use multiplication, division or modulus
 *
 * - Basically, the global rules are you can only use logical (&&, ||) and
 *   bitwise (&, |, ^, >>, <<) operators, as well as the unary negation (-)
 *   operator, all in one line.
 *
 * Method-specific rules for this file:
 * - You may not use bit shifting or the exclusive OR operator (^) in xor.
 *
 * Some notes:
 *
 * All of these functions accept ints as parameters because if you pass in a
 * number (which is of type int by default) into a Method accepting a byte, then
 * the Java compiler will complain even if the number would fit into that type.
 *
 * Now, keep in mind the return value is also an int. Please read the comments
 * about how many significant bits to return and make sure that the other bits
 * are not set or else you will not get any points for that test case. For
 * example, if we ask you to return 6 bits and you return "0xFFFFFFFF", you will
 * lose points.
 *
 * Definitions of types:
 * nibble - 4 bits
 * byte   - 8 bits
 * short  - 16 bits
 * int    - 32 bits
